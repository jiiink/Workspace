Are you going to Scarborough Fair $$
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme $$
Remember me to one who lives there $$
She once was a true love of mine $$

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt $$
On the side of a hill in the deep forest green $$
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme $$
Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown $$
Without no seams nor needless work $$
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain $$
Then she'll be a true love of mine $$
Sleeps wnaware of the clarion call $$

Tell her to find me an acre of land
on the side of a hill a sprinking of leaves $$
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme $$
Washes the grave with silvery tears $$
Between the salt water and the sea strands $$
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun $$
Then she'll be a true love of mine $$

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
war bellows blazing in scarlet battalions $$
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme Generals order their soldier to kill $$
And gather it all in a bunch of heather And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten $$
Then she'll be a true love of mine $$

Are you going to Scarborough Fair $$
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme $$
Remember me to one who lives there she once was a true love of mine $$
