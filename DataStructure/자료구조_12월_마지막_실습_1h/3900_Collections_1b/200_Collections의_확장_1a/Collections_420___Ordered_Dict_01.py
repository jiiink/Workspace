"""
OrderedDicts are just like regular dictionaries but they remember the order
that items were inserted. When iterating over an ordered dictionary,
the items are returned in the order their keys were first added.
If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is
left unchanged. They have become less important now that the built-in dict
class gained the ability to remember insertion order (guaranteed since Python 3.7).
But some differences still remain, e.g. the OrderedDict is designed to be good at
reordering operations.
