>> 'And why not?' said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer, 'you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!' But don't blame her, don't blame her, honoured sir, don't blame her! 
>> 'Behold the man!' Excuse me, young man, can you... . 
>> 'Marmeladov, once already you have deceived my expectations ... I'll take you once more on my own responsibility'--that's what he said, 'remember,' he said, 'and now you can go.' I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas. 
>> 'Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a salary,' says she, 'and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study.' Do you hear, do you hear? 
>> 'Semyon Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!' They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! 
>> 'There can be no question of love,' mother writes. 
>> 'To be sure,' says he, 'Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he, 'and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we've got on badly without you,' (do you hear, do you hear;) 'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman.' And all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she does! 
>> 'You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.' Oh, mother! His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to meet Mr.Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him. 
>> 'You too come forth,' He will say, 'Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame!' And we shall all come forth, without shame and shall stand before him. 
>> ... And where is the money? 
>> ... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our most rising generation'? 
>> ... But allow me... . 
>> ... Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? 
>> ... His eyes were dim when he heard my story. 
>> ... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. 
>> ... Six days ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: 'poppet,' said she, 'my little poppet.' And when we were by ourselves, you understand? 
>> ... Well, she pinched my cheek, 'my little poppet,' said she. 
>> ... and all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even ... she will understand... . 
>> A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. 
>> A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a beating. 
>> A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go ... that way ... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered with. 
>> A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. 
>> A few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father. 
>> A fine clerk he is! And so on, and so on. 
>> A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. 
>> A kind man, no doubt after that! 
>> A letter came for you yesterday when you were out. 
>> A letter? 
>> A little kerchief was flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. 
>> A little table stood in front of the sofa. 
>> A magnificent excuse: 'Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in post-haste, almost by express.' No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother's bedroom. 
>> A month ago when Mr.Lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn't I suffer? 
>> A peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts, all singing and all more or less drunk. 
>> A percentage! 
>> A rouble and a half! cried the young man. 
>> A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like! 
>> A student then, or formerly a student, cried the clerk. 
>> A very poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end; the whole of it was visible from the entrance. 
>> About two months before, they had met in the street, but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed. 
>> Ach, ach, how shocking! 
>> Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. 
>> After It, he shouted, jumping up from the seat, but is It really going to happen? 
>> After dark maybe when no one can see.' Do you hear, do you hear? 
>> Afterwards on the stairs, he changed his mind and would have gone back. 
>> Ah! she cried out in a frenzy, he has come back! 
>> Ah, I forgot! 
>> Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have mercy on us! 
>> Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! 
>> Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! he repeated aloud, sighing. 
>> Ah, what a pity! he said, shaking his head--why, she is quite a child! 
>> All in one bunch on a steel ring... . 
>> All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. 
>> All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing and the balalaika, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders. 
>> All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. 
>> All right! 
>> All that's nonsense, he said hopefully, and there is nothing in it all to worry about! 
>> All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia's account. 
>> All this was set going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at her in every family. 
>> Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva? 
>> Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov's face was wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. 
>> Am I capable of that? 
>> An awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant's cart, into which they flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it. 
>> An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face. 
>> An innocent creature like that, drunk already! 
>> And He will judge and will forgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek... . 
>> And He will say unto us, 'Ye are swine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!' And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, 'Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?' And He will say, 'This is why I receive them, oh ye wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.' And He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down before him ... and we shall weep ... and we shall understand all things! 
>> And I accept it all, not with contempt, but with humility. 
>> And I am drinking it! 
>> And I don't blame her for it, no, I don't blame her! 
>> And I have already drunk it! 
>> And I went on lying there, just as before... . 
>> And I'm sick of it. 
>> And I? 
>> And Katerina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that disease: 'Here you live with us,' says she, 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.' And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days! 
>> And Pyotr Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man. 
>> And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can... . 
>> And a great deal more... . 
>> And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town. 
>> And all her shawls don't add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know that. 
>> And although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone. 
>> And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even certain differences of opinion --which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages-- Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. 
>> And as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe... . 
>> And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. 
>> And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. 
>> And even if she does not, the Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there. 
>> And for a whole year, I performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this (he tapped the jug with his finger), for I have feelings. 
>> And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the pork-butcher's. 
>> And have you made much money by your thinking? she managed to articulate at last. 
>> And here ... I am again on the same errand, Raskolnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman's mistrust. 
>> And here I, her own father, here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! 
>> And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. 
>> And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? 
>> And how do you think it was all explained later on? 
>> And how have they been brought to it? 
>> And how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit-- eleven roubles, fifty copecks, I can't guess. 
>> And how will your mother feel then? 
>> And if Mr.Luzhin had been of unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to become his legal concubine. 
>> And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, very natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband; this she is reckoning upon. 
>> And it would have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been inevitable. 
>> And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life with Mr.Luzhin. 
>> And maybe Sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting big game ... digging for gold ... then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money. 
>> And maybe she needs them now, eh? 
>> And mother too, why should she be so lavish? 
>> And now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he was holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern. 
>> And now look there: I don't know that dandy with whom I was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she is in this state ... that's certain, believe me, I am not wrong. 
>> And now may I venture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with a private question. 
>> And now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with Mr.Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband's bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. 
>> And now, my precious Rodya, I embrace you and send you a mother's blessing till we meet. 
>> And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others. 
>> And she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and downs of all sort, I don't feel equal to describing it even. 
>> And she was proud, too, excessively proud... . 
>> And she was sure to be vexed and 'answered her angrily.' I should think so! 
>> And suddenly he realised what he was thinking. 
>> And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat. 
>> And that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. 
>> And that very Dounia for that very 'seems' is marrying him! 
>> And the more I drink the more I feel it. 
>> And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the window. 
>> And the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family... . 
>> And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence go up to Sonia's little bed; she was on her knees all the evening kissing Sonia's feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell asleep in each other's arms ... together, together ... yes ... and I ... lay drunk. 
>> And then I will go of myself to be crucified, for it's not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation! 
>> And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. 
>> And there are the little ones hungry... . 
>> And there was something respectable and like an official about his manner too. 
>> And there's one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches; that can't be the key of the chest of drawers ... then there must be some other chest or strong-box ... that's worth knowing. 
>> And there's pomatum, too, you see, she must have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle. 
>> And therefore they had to take turns, so that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people's. 
>> And they are hungry, hungry!--and wringing her hands she pointed to the children. 
>> And they are pleased, pleased! 
>> And they're making the most of it! 
>> And this is a consolation to me! 
>> And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates! 
>> And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed him by, as he did not want to annoy him. 
>> And to think that this is only the first blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! 
>> And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him. 
>> And what are you doing now? 
>> And what if I am wrong, he cried suddenly after a moment's thought. 
>> And what if it's more than you can bear afterwards, if you regret it? 
>> And what if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion, contempt, repulsion, what then? 
>> And what put the idea of going to Razumihin into my head just now? 
>> And what right have you? 
>> And what's more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew. 
>> And when He has done with all of them, then He will summon us. 
>> And why did I want to interfere? 
>> And why does she write to me, 'love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than herself'? 
>> And why don't you work, why aren't you at your duty, if you are in the service? 
>> And yet ... oh, if only she felt for me! 
>> And yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. 
>> And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. 
>> And yet though I know beforehand that he won't, I set off to him and ... 
>> And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: Hey there, German hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. 
>> And yet, although I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man, he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--but, my God, if she would but once... . 
>> And you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. 
>> And you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey. 
>> And you want to get a fortune all at once? He looked at her strangely. 
>> And you, are you not ashamed?--she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov--from the tavern! 
>> And your clothes are all different! 
>> And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. 
>> And, besides, it was obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. 
>> Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. 
>> Anyway he must decide on something, or else ... 
>> Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia's reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly. 
>> Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? 
>> As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. 
>> As he went out, Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window. 
>> As soon as I had read the letter I came out... . 
>> As soon as Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven. 
>> As you please. 
>> At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: 'how,' said he, 'can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?' And Katerina Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her ... and so that's how it happened. 
>> At first indeed Mr.Svidrigailov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table... . 
>> At first, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly. 
>> At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions 'of our most rising generation' and he is an opponent of all prejudices. 
>> At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box. 
>> At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and resolutely: 
>> At last he opened it; it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting. 
>> At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear. 
>> At six o'clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine o'clock she came back. 
>> At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps. 
>> At that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing 
>> At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him. 
>> At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. 
>> At the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. 
>> At the other persons in the room, including the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to converse. 
>> At the same time her large dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face, were watching her mother with alarm. 
>> At the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness. 
>> At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food. 
>> At times monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are so truthlike and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking state. 
>> Behind it probably was the bed. 
>> Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees. 
>> Besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with him. 
>> Besides the two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. 
>> Bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. 
>> Bitter is the ascent to Golgotha... . 
>> Boots, cotton shirt- fronts--most magnificent, a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and a half. 
>> Bother my hair! 
>> But Dounia was vexed, and answered that 'words are not deeds,' and that, of course, is perfectly true. 
>> But I am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence. 
>> But I am talking too much. 
>> But I don't want to go into all those painful details, so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. 
>> But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust... . 
>> But Mr.Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that's what is done now in England, where there is political economy. 
>> But a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said: 
>> But although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much money as I can in a day or two. 
>> But at last he lost all control and had the face to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his, or even abroad. 
>> But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a police constable stood between them. 
>> But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice. 
>> But blows I am not afraid of... . 
>> But by God's mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.Svidrigailov returned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia's innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden. 
>> But enough; I have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole history, but so many events have happened! 
>> But even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal. 
>> But even so, I could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch it! 
>> But evidently she decided that he was going into the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. 
>> But for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance. 
>> But having given him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done, so that I've been unable to send you anything all this time. 
>> But he did not start at the thought recurring to him, for he knew, he had felt beforehand, that it must come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday's thought. 
>> But he was restless; he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table. 
>> But her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it! 
>> But his bride and her mother are to drive in a peasant's cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in it). 
>> But his sleep had not refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room. 
>> But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don't blame! 
>> But it's no use going over that! 
>> But my mother? 
>> But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. 
>> But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. 
>> But no, no! 
>> But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people. 
>> But now, strange to say, in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants' nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut. 
>> But now, thank God, I believe I shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. 
>> But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight. 
>> But reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging. 
>> But she did! 
>> But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability. 
>> But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once. 
>> But the time is up for your last pledge. 
>> But there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more intently. 
>> But there was nothing special in the room. 
>> But there was something very strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness. 
>> But there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in the street. 
>> But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen. 
>> But we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see that the journey will not cost very much. 
>> But what are you going to do to prevent it? 
>> But what do you mean by hopelessly? 
>> But what does it matter? 
>> But what if Dounia were one of the percentage! 
>> But what really matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the tone of the whole thing. 
>> But where am I going? he thought suddenly. 
>> But why is it you do nothing now? 
>> But why, if you are so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? 
>> But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and opened the door wide. 
>> CHAPTER II 
>> CHAPTER III 
>> CHAPTER IV 
>> CHAPTER V 
>> Can you bear it? 
>> Can you fancy? So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it. 
>> Coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway. 
>> Come along! The crowd laughed. 
>> Come along, come along! said his father. 
>> Come, who will have pity on a man like me, eh? 
>> Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of Razumihin alone? he asked himself in perplexity. 
>> Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me! 
>> D'you hear, she'll gallop! 
>> Did you meet her far from here? he asked him. 
>> Dirt and disorder, a perfect Bedlam ... hm ... yes ... And meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won't speak of. 
>> Do you know, my precious Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old- womanish, fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, after the wedding. 
>> Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very stockings for drink? 
>> Do you still say your prayers, Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? 
>> Do you suppose I don't feel it? 
>> Do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? 
>> Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same thing as Sonia's and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case, Dounia, it's a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it's simply a question of starvation. 
>> Do you understand what that smartness means? 
>> Do you understand, sir, do you understand what all that smartness means? 
>> Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? 
>> Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? Marmeladov's question came suddenly into his mind, for every man must have somewhere to turn... . 
>> Do you understand? 
>> Do you understand? 
>> Do you understand? 
>> Does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm I am? 
>> Don't be anxious, I won't let him have her, the policeman said resolutely, and he set off after them. 
>> Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! 
>> Don't quarrel with your bread and butter. 
>> Don't you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready! 
>> Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. 
>> Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! 
>> Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided. 
>> Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. 
>> Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. 
>> Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree with her. 
>> Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families, but she refused. 
>> Drunken and horrible-looking figures were hanging about the tavern. 
>> Enough of him, confound him! 
>> Even now she is uneasy, she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? 
>> Everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone. 
>> Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern. 
>> Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you ... hm ... well, to petition hopelessly for a loan? 
>> Father, father, he cried, father, what are they doing? 
>> Father, they are beating the poor horse! 
>> Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. 
>> For I can feel it all... . 
>> For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about us. 
>> For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. 
>> For every man must have somewhere to go. 
>> For he knows of course that I shan't pay it back. 
>> For if Sonia has not taken them food ... I don't know what's happened! 
>> For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man of feeling and education. 
>> For instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia's consent, in the course of conversation, he declared that before making Dounia's acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor. 
>> For more than once, my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but ... such is my fate and I am a beast by nature! 
>> For now she's got to keep up her appearance. 
>> For one she loves, for one she adores, she will sell herself! 
>> For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr.Lebeziatnikov too ... hm... . 
>> For she had nowhere to turn! 
>> For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! 
>> For that will be the tone after marriage, it's a foretaste of it. 
>> For that's Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. 
>> For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again. 
>> For this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible... . 
>> For two hours they were sitting, whispering together. 
>> For, though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited lady, irritable and short--tempered... . 
>> Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking. 
>> From compassion? 
>> From the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not close the door. 
>> From the landlady, eh? he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa. 
>> From the landlady, indeed! She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it. 
>> From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. 
>> Funny fellow! pronounced the innkeeper. 
>> Further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of them with cards in their hands. 
>> Gallop indeed! 
>> Get away, that's what I mean. 
>> Get in! 
>> Get in, I tell you! 
>> Get in, I'll take you all, Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. 
>> Get in, all get in, cried Mikolka, she will draw you all. 
>> Get in, get in! shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot. 
>> Get up, why are you asleep? she called to him. 
>> Give it to her! They all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing and making jokes. 
>> Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father's. 
>> Go away! 
>> Go away! The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. 
>> Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort. 
>> Good-bye, till we meet then-- I embrace you warmly, warmly, with many kisses. 
>> Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with you? He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage. 
>> Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna. 
>> Granted that he 'let it slip,' though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible) but Dounia, Dounia? 
>> Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. 
>> Hand it over, he said roughly. 
>> Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son? 
>> Have I any right to help? 
>> Have not I seen cases like that? 
>> Have you been drinking with him? 
>> Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe ... when they are excited? 
>> Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both of you? 
>> He always liked looking at those great cart- horses, with their long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going with a load than without it. 
>> He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more drunk, he became more and more talkative. 
>> He controlled himself however. 
>> He could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. 
>> He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. 
>> He could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. 
>> He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. 
>> He did not remember him at all, but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave. 
>> He dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth. 
>> He felt a hammering in his head, and there was a darkness before his eyes. 
>> He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman. 
>> He felt vexed that he had come here. 
>> He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. 
>> He finished eating it as he walked away. 
>> He found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment. 
>> He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday, slipped back into his mind. 
>> He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside the young man, facing him a little sideways. 
>> He had a straight-forward, sensible, soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers. 
>> He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. 
>> He had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams. 
>> He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him... . 
>> He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. 
>> He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. 
>> He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. 
>> He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. 
>> He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important case. 
>> He has carried off my twenty copecks, Raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone. 
>> He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before the Senate. 
>> He is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father's too. 
>> He is a practical man and might take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. 
>> He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. 
>> He is a well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune. 
>> He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been very active in bringing the match about. 
>> He is wax ... wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth! 
>> He knew of no end of resources by which to earn money. 
>> He knew that the flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his family. 
>> He laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long time. 
>> He left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman. 
>> He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. 
>> He longed to forget himself altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life anew... . 
>> He looked angrily at him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. 
>> He looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know what. 
>> He looked repeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. 
>> He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. 
>> He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. 
>> He overtook the girl at the seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes, apparently in extreme exhaustion. 
>> He pointed at the dandy, What is it to do with you? The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. 
>> He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic thought came into his head. 
>> He pounced upon Raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month. 
>> He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he was hungry... . 
>> He said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. 
>> He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. 
>> He sat down on the deserted seat. 
>> He saw before him the face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking and, as it were, swollen. 
>> He scowled. 
>> He seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him. 
>> He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in the cold. 
>> He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained by now. 
>> He struck me, for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. 
>> He then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted. 
>> He took no part in the students' gatherings, amusements or conversations. 
>> He took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting anyone; he had forgotten his dread. 
>> He turned homewards, but reaching Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep. 
>> He turned in the direction of the Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the astonishment of the passers-by. 
>> He turned pale when he took it. 
>> He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having once been happy... . 
>> He used to cling close to his father, trembling all over when he met them. 
>> He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. 
>> He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next street. 
>> He walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention. 
>> He wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K---- Boulevard. 
>> He was a child about seven years old, walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. 
>> He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height, and stoutly built. 
>> He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. 
>> He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office. 
>> He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. 
>> He was drunk, but spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his sentences and drawling his words. 
>> He was extremely intelligent, though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. 
>> He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her. 
>> He was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing. 
>> He was met, too, by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight. 
>> He was of striking appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. 
>> He was positively going now for a 
>> He was properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer. 
>> He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company. 
>> He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. 
>> He was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern. 
>> He was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength. 
>> He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these: 
>> He was very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another. 
>> He was very poor, and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though he were keeping something to himself. 
>> He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability. 
>> He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. 
>> He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! 
>> He will come in that day and He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? 
>> He wondered at himself. 
>> He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock. 
>> He worked with great intensity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. 
>> He's drunk it! 
>> He, too, appeared to be in some agitation. 
>> He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. 
>> He, too, must have seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money! 
>> He, too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own. 
>> He-he-he! 
>> He-he-he! He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. 
>> Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration. 
>> Hence the pot-house! 
>> Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother's neck. 
>> Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. 
>> Her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. 
>> Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. 
>> Her relations had all thrown her off. 
>> Here I obtained a situation... . 
>> Here it is. 
>> Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness, no stench. 
>> Here, Nastasya, take it please, he said, fumbling in his pocket (for he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--run and buy me a loaf. 
>> Here, said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks, here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. 
>> Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. 
>> Hey! 
>> Hey, here! he shouted after the policeman. 
>> His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. 
>> His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you know him? 
>> His eyes and his mind craved for space. 
>> His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. 
>> His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. 
>> His hands, particularly, were filthy. 
>> His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil. 
>> His intentions were unmistakable. 
>> His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her, though he went without his dinner. 
>> His legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him. 
>> His mother's letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief fact in it, he had felt not one moment's hesitation, even whilst he was reading the letter. 
>> His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. 
>> His thoughts strayed aimlessly... . 
>> His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a--a year he--fondly loved. 
>> His words had created a certain impression; there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard again. 
>> Hm ... so it is finally settled; you have determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one who has a fortune (has already made his fortune, that is so much more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who seems to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. 
>> Hm ... to Razumihin's, he said all at once, calmly, as though he had reached a final determination. 
>> Hm ... yes ... very poor people and all with cleft palates ... yes. 
>> Hm ... yes, all is in a man's hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. 
>> Hm ... yes, that's true, he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain, it is true that 'it needs time and care to get to know a man,' but there is no mistake about Mr.Luzhin. 
>> Hm! 
>> Honoured sir, a month ago Mr.Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me! 
>> Honoured sir, he began almost with solemnity, poverty is not a vice, that's a true saying. 
>> Honoured sir, honoured sir, cried Marmeladov recovering himself-- 
>> Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! 
>> Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it. 
>> How are you going to save them from Svidrigailovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for them? 
>> How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? 
>> How dare you, you low fellow! He raised his cane. 
>> How did I dare to give him twenty copecks? 
>> How is it that they don't both see all that, or is it that they don't want to see? 
>> How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna? 
>> Hurrah for Sonia! 
>> I am a student, Raskolnikov... . 
>> I am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. 
>> I am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. 
>> I am doing ... 
>> I am frightened of the children's crying, too... . 
>> I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of realising them. 
>> I am thinking, he answered seriously after a pause. 
>> I can't say. 
>> I dare say! 
>> I did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books, and what books we had ... hm, anyway we have not even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. 
>> I don't condemn her for it, I don't blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. 
>> I don't know! 
>> I drink so that I may suffer twice as much! And as though in despair he laid his head down on the table. 
>> I exchanged it for the garments I have on ... and it's the end of everything! Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. 
>> I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. 
>> I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler's for a rouble and a half. 
>> I give you this warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you. 
>> I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. 
>> I have already forgiven thee once... . 
>> I have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in rank. 
>> I have forgiven thee once... . 
>> I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open a legal bureau. 
>> I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with their mothers-in- law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone's way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and Dounia. 
>> I have the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer's daughter. 
>> I knew it, he muttered in confusion, I thought so! 
>> I knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that 'Dounia can put up with a great deal.' If she could put up with Mr.Svidrigailov and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. 
>> I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee. 
>> I make bold to inquire--have you been in the service? 
>> I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona Ivanovna --a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it back from a friend ... 
>> I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning. 
>> I obtained it and I lost it again. 
>> I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! 
>> I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here, the old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face. 
>> I returned home, and when I announced that I'd been taken back into the service and should receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was ...! Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. 
>> I saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. 
>> I saw him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he is just waiting for me to go away. 
>> I shall be getting some money soon. 
>> I shall go to Razumihin's of course, but ... not now. 
>> I shall go to him ... on the next day after It, when It will be over and everything will begin afresh... . 
>> I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since? 
>> I should like to know whether Mr.Luzhin has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants. 
>> I should think you're fairly starving? Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya. 
>> I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in the boulevard. 
>> I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink... . 
>> I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles, he thought, with an odd smile. 
>> I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. 
>> I was in despair myself, but what could I do? 
>> I was in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified and indignant, and yet what could you do? 
>> I was lying at the time ... well, what of it! 
>> I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice ... fair hair and such a pale, thin little face). 
>> I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little. 
>> I won't accept it! He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still. 
>> I won't have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won't have it, mother! 
>> I would send you more, but I am uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we can't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. 
>> I'll beat her to death! And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself with fury. 
>> I'll fetch you a cab and take you home myself. 
>> I'll go and talk to her to-day. 
>> I'll make her gallop! 
>> I'll take you all, get in! But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd. 
>> I'm a man of experience, immense experience, sir, and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. 
>> I'm going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did. 
>> I've brought something to pawn here, and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel. 
>> I've learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking ... of Jack the Giant-killer. 
>> I, of course, understood very little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. 
>> If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that I were really going to do it? he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. 
>> If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted. 
>> If only you are happy, we shall be happy. 
>> If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years! 
>> If we had any other word ... maybe we might feel more uneasy... . 
>> Imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years? 
>> In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. 
>> In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. 
>> In another ten years, mother will be blind with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. 
>> In another ten years? 
>> In fact I can't get on without it... . 
>> In my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna's character. 
>> In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary--never--no one. 
>> In short, in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr.Svidrigailov's wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr.Svidrigailov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. 
>> In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him. 
>> In such cases, 'we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,' freedom, peace, conscience even, all, all are brought into the market. 
>> In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough already. 
>> In that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. 
>> In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. 
>> In the first place, she appeared to be a girl quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. 
>> In the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future. 
>> In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never seen. 
>> In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands. 
>> In this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others. 
>> Indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with Razumihin. 
>> Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of ... it's her eyes I am afraid of ... yes, her eyes ... the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me ... and her breathing too... . 
>> Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot read it without tears. 
>> Is it any use? 
>> Is it for me to help? 
>> Is it possible it really will happen? He left the seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards, but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing; in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all this had for a month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random. 
>> Is it right? 
>> Is not that so? 
>> Is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when Afanasy Ivanovitch's debt is paid? 
>> Is that serious? 
>> Is there sense in it? 
>> It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. 
>> It all ended very unexpectedly. 
>> It appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but their room was practically a passage. 
>> It began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. 
>> It costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? 
>> It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling. 
>> It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. 
>> It has to be paid for, it has to be paid for, Dounia, this smartness. 
>> It is not serious at all. 
>> It is only ninety versts and then they can 'travel very comfortably, third class,' for a thousand versts! 
>> It is only ninety versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel quite comfortably third class. 
>> It is settled for certain that Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week. 
>> It is true that he is forty-five years old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited. 
>> It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable... . 
>> It made me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! 
>> It must be the top drawer, he reflected. 
>> It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days. 
>> It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not! 
>> It shall not be? 
>> It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse. 
>> It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded. 
>> It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. 
>> It was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it; indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory. 
>> It was a long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart. 
>> It was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once, though he only drank a wineglassful. 
>> It was a strange and shocking sight. 
>> It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion. 
>> It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. 
>> It was a winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the right to the graveyard. 
>> It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children's garments. 
>> It was clear that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it quickly. 
>> It was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk. 
>> It was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. 
>> It was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs. 
>> It was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods. 
>> It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave him up. 
>> It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge. 
>> It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. 
>> It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable. 
>> It's a bitter thing to spend one's life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common--for her own advantage. 
>> It's a difficult job, the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. 
>> It's all Rodya, precious Rodya, her first born! 
>> It's all in vain and it's no use talking! 
>> It's as clear as day what he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off! Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. 
>> It's because I chatter that I do nothing. 
>> It's better so. 
>> It's capital soup, yesterday's. 
>> It's clear enough: for herself, for her comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone else she is doing it! 
>> It's clear that Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. 
>> It's fine soup. 
>> It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness, Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman's bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before. 
>> It's more likely she has been given drink and deceived somewhere ... for the first time ... you understand? 
>> It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now, he muttered in agitation--and that she will begin pulling my hair. 
>> It's past nine, I have brought you some tea; will you have a cup? 
>> It's really absurd for me to go to Razumihin... . 
>> It's shameful, missy, it's a shame! He shook his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant. 
>> It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! 
>> It's simply physical derangement. 
>> It's the fifth day since I left home, and they are looking for me there and it's the end of my employment, and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. 
>> Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! 
>> Just so. 
>> Just what I thought! 
>> Keep her out of his hands we can, said the constable thoughtfully, if only she'd tell us where to take her, but as it is... . 
>> Know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit. 
>> Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. 
>> Lead the way! They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. 
>> Let her go! 
>> Let her strike me, it relieves her heart ... it's better so ... There is the house. 
>> Let him amuse himself. 
>> Let me get in, too, mates, shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused. 
>> Let my life go, if only my dear ones may be happy! 
>> Let them be! 
>> Let them devour each other alive--what is to me? 
>> Let us go, sir, said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and addressing Raskolnikov--come along with me ... Kozel's house, looking into the yard. 
>> Like a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush. 
>> Listen, lady, he began addressing her, where do you live? The girl opened her weary and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand. 
>> Lizaveta's work, thought the young man. 
>> Long, long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. 
>> Look at the way her dress is torn, and the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man's hands; that's evident. 
>> Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard. 
>> Looking at her closely, he saw at once that she was completely drunk. 
>> Looking for the seat, he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path. 
>> Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement. 
>> Lord, Thy kingdom come! And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought. 
>> Love Dounia your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything, more than herself. 
>> Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel! He sank into thought. 
>> Many of them took him to be drunk. 
>> Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. 
>> Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and 'again crushed' as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of Dounia's innocence. 
>> Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began to twitch. 
>> Marmeladov did not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. 
>> Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story. 
>> Marmeladov seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees. 
>> Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. 
>> Marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table. 
>> Marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search. 
>> Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man. 
>> Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. 
>> May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation? 
>> Missy, hey, missy! he bent over her once more. 
>> Missy, missy! the policeman began again, taking the money. 
>> More than that, we become casuists, we learn to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can persuade ourselves that it is one's duty for a good object. 
>> Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. 
>> Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr.Svidrigailov had himself supposed --as indeed is always the case with servants. 
>> Most likely it was partly like that, from mother's letter it's evident: he struck her as rude a little, and mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. 
>> Mother writes that 'Dounia can put up with a great deal.' I know that very well. 
>> My dear Rodya, wrote his mother--it's two months since I last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night, thinking. 
>> Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. 
>> Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are your three copecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste and go! The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her presence; he wanted to be left alone with this letter. 
>> Nastasya, the cook and only servant, was rather pleased at the lodger's mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom. 
>> Near his grandmother's grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old. 
>> Near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart, but a strange cart. 
>> Near the tavern the road became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. 
>> No matter! 
>> No matter, sir, no matter! he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled--No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all that is secret is made open. 
>> No use talking! 
>> No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew her and ... she is still the same, of course! 
>> No, I am studying, answered the young man, somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed. 
>> No, I have not happened to, answered Raskolnikov. 
>> No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish! he added resolutely. 
>> No, mother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me! 
>> No, that you don't understand yet... . 
>> No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not can you but dare you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig? The young man did not answer a word. 
>> No? 
>> Nobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered... . 
>> Nor has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself, later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your own work. 
>> Not a farthing was there. 
>> Not fifteen farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! 
>> Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink! 
>> Not on earth, but up yonder ... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don't blame them, they don't blame them! 
>> Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him. 
>> Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. 
>> Now he has walked away a little, and is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette... . 
>> Now his mother's letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. 
>> Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? 
>> Now that everyone has heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. 
>> Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. 
>> Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this 
>> Of another one if not that one? 
>> Of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch, especially of your becoming his partner. 
>> Of course, I've been meaning lately to go to Razumihin's to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or something ... 
>> Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care. 
>> Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. 
>> Often he went to sleep on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old student's overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. 
>> Oh shameful wretches, they won't let me alone! she said, waving her hand again. 
>> Oh, accursed life! 
>> Oh, if only this comes to pass! 
>> Oh, loving, over-partial hearts! 
>> Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. 
>> Oh, sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me. 
>> Oh, the cunning of them! 
>> Oh, with what happiness I shall press you to my heart! 
>> Oh, yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his life a famous man! 
>> On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S.Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K.bridge. 
>> On the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. 
>> On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross. 
>> On whom is she reckoning then? 
>> Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had thirty copecks. 
>> Once you've said 'percentage' there's nothing more to worry about. 
>> One can't go out to give lessons without boots. 
>> One must cut one's coat according to one's cloth, but what about you, Mr.Luzhin? 
>> One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back. 
>> One time you used to go out, you say, to teach children. 
>> Only think now what answer could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and what could I have written? 
>> Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. 
>> Or suddenly waking up again: 
>> Or throw up life altogether! he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--accept one's lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love! 
>> Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. 
>> PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV. 
>> People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. 
>> Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, looking like ladies and refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness... . 
>> Perhaps she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other time, he thought with an uneasy feeling. 
>> Phew, how utterly petty it all is! But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room. 
>> Please yourself--and the old woman handed him back the watch. 
>> Poor girl! he said, looking at the empty corner where she had sat-- 
>> Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia. 
>> Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you, she said. 
>> Quite excusable, sir. 
>> Quite right, too. 
>> Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly. 
>> Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her, and stood facing her in perplexity. 
>> Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way. 
>> Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. 
>> Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him. 
>> Raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even know his address. 
>> Raskolnikov laughed. 
>> Raskolnikov listened attentively. 
>> Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation. 
>> Raskolnikov looked at him intently. 
>> Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. 
>> Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself. 
>> Raskolnikov thought, but what help can he be to me now? 
>> Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided society of every sort, more especially of late. 
>> Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. 
>> Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago, the young man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more polite. 
>> Rather! assented the innkeeper yawning. 
>> Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the university. 
>> Remember, dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those days. 
>> Round her thin long neck, which looked like a hen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow with age. 
>> See how her dress has been torn too... . 
>> Shall I get you the loaf or not? 
>> She did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were constantly in communication. 
>> She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl (we have a shawl, made of drap de dames), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering... . 
>> She drew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last. 
>> She had not any dresses ... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; and not that she'd anything to do it with, she smartened herself up with nothing at all, she'd done her hair nicely, put on a clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different person, she was younger and better looking. 
>> She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in. 
>> She had on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. 
>> She has a room at the Kapernaumovs' the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too. 
>> She has been deceived, that's a sure thing. 
>> She has been deceived, you can see that at once. 
>> She has been in a sort of fever for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are a student of law. 
>> She has her reasons already for guessing that she could not live with Dounia after the marriage, even for the first few months. 
>> She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years! 
>> She is a fool, he added aloud. 
>> She is a resolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well. 
>> She is an angel and you, Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. 
>> She is an angel! 
>> She is an angel! 
>> She is not writing anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much, so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. 
>> She is your bride... . 
>> She knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. 
>> She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town, but over the whole surrounding district. 
>> She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady, and he bent over her once more. 
>> She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father's house. 
>> She only just reached the seat and sank down on it. 
>> She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come. 
>> She said nothing, she only looked at me without a word... . 
>> She said: 'Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing like that?' And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady. 
>> She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won't allow herself to be treated with disrespect. 
>> She seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for Marmeladov... . 
>> She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. 
>> She understands the man, of course, but she will have to live with the man. 
>> She waked him up that day. 
>> She walked quickly, though staggering as before. 
>> She walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence. 
>> She was a country peasant-woman and a very talkative one. 
>> She was a diminutive, withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose. 
>> She was a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. 
>> She was a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the other. 
>> She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing. 
>> She was exceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he died. 
>> She was given to laughter and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill. 
>> She was not herself when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything else... . 
>> She was pacing up and down in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. 
>> She was trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again. 
>> She will be worn to a shadow with fasting; and my sister? 
>> She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find out... . 
>> She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and then maybe, turn her out of doors... . 
>> She will sell everything! 
>> She'll gallop! and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare. 
>> She'll jog along! 
>> She's just eating her head off. 
>> Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. 
>> Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of Mr.Luzhin? 
>> Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through Mr.Lebeziatnikov, Lewes' Physiology--do you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that's the whole of her education. 
>> Since then, sir, he went on after a brief pause--Since then, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil- intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us. 
>> Since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere! 
>> Six men got in and there was still room for more. 
>> So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. 
>> So be it! 
>> So be it! 
>> So she carries the keys in a pocket on the right. 
>> So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr.Luzhin's generosity; 'he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.' You may wait a long time for that! 
>> So that I may very likely be able to send to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. 
>> So the sun will shine like this then too! flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikov's mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement. 
>> So you will have to 'keep up your appearance,' too. 
>> So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you. 
>> Something new seemed to be taking place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. 
>> Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies, and children running in the gardens. 
>> Sonia wants pomatum too, he said as he walked along the street, and he laughed malignantly--such smartness costs money... . 
>> Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long as the world lasts. 
>> Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. 
>> Sonia, my little darling, had only helped with money 'for the time,' she said, 'it won't do for me to come and see you too often. 
>> Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it. 
>> Speak! And she fell to searching him. 
>> Splendid! 
>> Step in, my good sir. 
>> Strange, I came out for something. 
>> Strong-boxes always have keys like that ... but how degrading it all is. 
>> Such is my fate! 
>> Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system. 
>> Such was the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired clerk. 
>> Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons ... hm ... Well and what then? 
>> Take us all with a beast like that! 
>> Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most... . 
>> Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway. 
>> Talked himself silly! 
>> Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? 
>> Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. 
>> That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. 
>> That seems beats everything! 
>> That was five weeks ago, sir. 
>> That was it: from his mother, from the province of R----. 
>> That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop! 
>> That's a good thing anyway, he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old woman's flat. 
>> That's as it should be, they tell us. 
>> That's curious. 
>> That's enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. 
>> That's his notion! 
>> That's how it always is with these Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture, yet they won't face the truth till they are forced to; the very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool's cap on them with his own hands. 
>> That's just like us, it's as clear as daylight. 
>> That's not what I want now. 
>> That's the worst of all! 
>> That's what I say! 
>> That's what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her mother, she will sell herself! 
>> That's what it was ... now I remember. 
>> That's what she wants, to be sure. 
>> That's why I drink too. 
>> That's why she would not overlook Mr.Lebeziatnikov's rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. 
>> The Hamlet were heard in the entry. 
>> The bay has gone with Matvey, he shouted from the cart--and this brute, mates, is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. 
>> The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper. 
>> The better of his comrades understood this, and all were fond of him. 
>> The bitterness, the misery, the curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa Petrovna. 
>> The boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. 
>> The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. 
>> The business man has got the better of them, too. 
>> The chief thing is he is 'a man of business and seems kind,' that was something, wasn't it, to send the bags and big box for them! 
>> The chief thing is, Raskolnikov persisted, to keep her out of this scoundrel's hands! 
>> The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. 
>> The criminal! 
>> The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help laughing? 
>> The dandy followed her, but along another avenue, keeping his eye on her. 
>> The devil, that's the last straw, he muttered, grinding his teeth, no, that would not suit me ... just now. 
>> The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: but now ... now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly became aware of this himself... . 
>> The door leading to the other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel's flat was divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter within. 
>> The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house. 
>> The eldest girl was shaking like a leaf. 
>> The essential question was settled, and irrevocably settled, in his mind: Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr.Luzhin be damned! 
>> The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. 
>> The fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension, from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. 
>> The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. 
>> The flowers especially caught his attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. 
>> The furniture was in keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched. 
>> The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was all. 
>> The gentleman heard him, and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemptuous look. 
>> The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and moustaches. 
>> The girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street. 
>> The girl was walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. 
>> The good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: 'I shall refuse,' says she. 
>> The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him. 
>> The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves. 
>> The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker ... a German, well-to-do. 
>> The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. 
>> The innkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the 
>> The insufferable stench from the pot- houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. 
>> The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. 
>> The latter turned round. 
>> The laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk. 
>> The laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop. 
>> The little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that. 
>> The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun. 
>> The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon. 
>> The loaf I'll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn't you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage? 
>> The luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing. 
>> The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person. 
>> The matter dropped for the time, but Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. 
>> The medal ... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm ... but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady. 
>> The month was up the day before yesterday. 
>> The old woman came back. 
>> The old woman coughed and groaned at every instant. 
>> The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room. 
>> The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass in front of her: 
>> The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. 
>> The only thing is to find out her address! 
>> The persons still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. 
>> The policeman bent over to examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion. 
>> The pot was empty. 
>> The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action. 
>> The recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. 
>> The room was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. 
>> The room was filled with noise. 
>> The same morning without any delay, she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering terms Dounia's innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior. 
>> The staircase got darker and darker as they went up. 
>> The stout gentleman was easy to understand, he turned to consider the girl. 
>> The tavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener. 
>> The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers. 
>> The thing is perfectly clear, he muttered to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision. 
>> The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. 
>> The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for. 
>> The young man did not dispute it and took the money. 
>> The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again. 
>> The young man often recalled this impression afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. 
>> The young man stepped into the dark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. 
>> The young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming. 
>> The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. 
>> The young man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. 
>> The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. 
>> Their departure left the room quiet and rather empty. 
>> Then I got up in the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. 
>> Then bring it to me, for God's sake, bring it, cried Raskolnikov greatly excited--good God! A minute later the letter was brought him. 
>> Then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat. 
>> Then she came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to forgive her. 
>> Then there will be the hospital directly (that's always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then ... again the hospital ... drink ... the taverns ... and more hospital, in two or three years--a wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen... . 
>> Then we shall understand all! 
>> There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. 
>> There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment, before a word is spoken. 
>> There are many like that nowadays. 
>> There his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. 
>> There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a professional. 
>> There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house. 
>> There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. 
>> There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse, hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. 
>> There was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk. 
>> There was no limit to his drinking powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether. 
>> There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat. 
>> There was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. 
>> There were few people at the time in the tavern. 
>> There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest! and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. 
>> There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. 
>> These two rooms made up the whole flat. 
>> They all live in one room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off... . 
>> They began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? 
>> They borrow from the Svidrigailovs. 
>> They borrow on their hundred roubles pension. 
>> They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. 
>> They had two or three hundred paces to go. 
>> They hauled in a fat, rosy-cheeked woman. 
>> They imagine it is arranged now and can't be broken off; but we will see whether it can or not! 
>> They pay so little for lessons. 
>> They were fat and red, with black nails. 
>> They were particularly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation to him. 
>> They won't let me alone, the girl muttered, and once more waved her hand. 
>> They've wept over it and grown used to it. 
>> Think how can we keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home? The policeman saw it all in a flash. 
>> Thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw... . 
>> Thirty copecks yes! 
>> This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. 
>> This boulevard was never much frequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite deserted. 
>> This confusion became more and more intense. 
>> This does not hurt me, but is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir, he called out, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead. 
>> This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears. 
>> This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home. 
>> This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. 
>> This letter, which remained in Mr.Svidrigailov's hands after her departure, she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating her. 
>> This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up! 
>> This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year. 
>> This time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come out... . 
>> This very quart was bought with her money, Marmeladov declared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. 
>> This was how it happened. 
>> This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. 
>> This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing. 
>> Three or four door-keepers were employed on the building. 
>> Three silver roubles or two 'paper ones' as she says... . 
>> Thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much... .' And he will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it ... I felt it in my heart when I was with her just now! 
>> Till that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst. 
>> To be pitied! 
>> To be sure it's a matter of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. 
>> To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. 
>> To suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible, even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is too soon to be ready, immediately after. 
>> To the police? 
>> Trifles, trifles are what matter! 
>> Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs yesterday, he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket. 
>> Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help Mikolka. 
>> Ugh! 
>> Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used to know. 
>> Was it all put into words, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it. 
>> We deceived you then, writing that this money came from Dounia's savings, but that was not so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has. 
>> We have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch. 
>> We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say. 
>> We have three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she's been used to cleanliness from a child. 
>> We stopped at Cyrus of Persia. 
>> We thought and talked it over the whole day. 
>> Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she married me! 
>> Well! ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse. 
>> Well, ... mother I don't wonder at, it's like her, God bless her, but how could Dounia? 
>> Well, I've just come from one and it's the fifth night I've slept so... . 
>> Well, let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. 
>> Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! 
>> Well, the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. 
>> Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know. 
>> Well, then, sir (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) 
>> Well, we will talk about it then, sir. 
>> Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! 
>> Were they mine? In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. 
>> What a grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work! 
>> What a mine they've dug there! 
>> What a stupid thing I've done, he thought to himself, they have Sonia and I want it myself. 
>> What are you doing? 
>> What are you to be pitied for? shouted the tavern-keeper who was again near them. 
>> What business is she of yours, my good sir? 
>> What can you promise them on your side to give you such a right? 
>> What do you mean? 
>> What do you mean? the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty astonishment. 
>> What do you think, my dear sir? 
>> What do you want here? he shouted, clenching his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage. 
>> What do you want? 
>> What do you want? the old woman said severely, coming into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face. 
>> What does my hair matter! 
>> What does she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? 
>> What does she want? 
>> What filthy things my heart is capable of. 
>> What for, though? 
>> What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it's all as it should be. 
>> What is it to do with you? 
>> What made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt. 
>> What matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue. 
>> What may happen to her during those ten years? 
>> What shall I do with the few coppers I earn? 
>> What sort of work? 
>> What splendid words they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory... . 
>> What was more, she showed and read to everyone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr.Svidrigailov and even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was superfluous. 
>> What will she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? 
>> What! 
>> What's in your pocket, show me! 
>> What's the answer? 
>> What's the point of it? 
>> What's the use of a few coppers? he answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought. 
>> When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance. 
>> When Nastasya had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write. 
>> When he was in the street he cried out, Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! 
>> When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had to go ... (for my daughter has a yellow passport), he added in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man. 
>> When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. 
>> When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round, he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going. 
>> When you came in I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. 
>> When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put up with in the Svidrigrailovs' house, when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to you? 
>> Where are your clothes? 
>> Where do you live? 
>> Where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father, undismayed by his beastliness?' And He will say, 'Come to me! 
>> Where is the money! 
>> Where is the money? she cried--Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all? 
>> Where shall I take you, eh? 
>> Who are you? he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his rags. 
>> Who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naive questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. 
>> Why am I going there now? 
>> Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir, Marmeladov went on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put that question to him. 
>> Why am I not at my duty? 
>> Why am I to be pitied, you say? 
>> Why am I to be pitied? Marmeladov suddenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only waiting for that question. 
>> Why do you go? put in Raskolnikov. 
>> Why is she consenting then? 
>> Why should he outrage her! 
>> Why! 
>> Why, I ask you, should he give it to me? 
>> Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart? 
>> Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan. 
>> Why, for his sake we would not shrink even from Sonia's fate. 
>> Why, it's just such trifles that always ruin everything... . 
>> Why, they've all come to it like that. 
>> Will you pay me back? 
>> With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and communicative with him. 
>> With a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into brooding. 
>> With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the street.

>> Words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time. 
>> Work ... 
>> Would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt. 
>> Yes! 
>> Yes, I want a fortune, he answered firmly, after a brief pause. 
>> Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I've been... . 
>> Yes, indeed, what have you taken me for? 
>> Yes, it has. 
>> Yes, maybe it is a plaything. 
>> Yes, my hat is too noticeable... . 
>> Yes, there's no denying, the Svidrigailovs are a bitter pill! 
>> Yes, they are making the most of it! 
>> Yes, we have heard all that before, and that's all words, but now? 
>> Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and determined. 
>> Yes. 
>> Yes... . 
>> Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that's even truer. 
>> You Svidrigailov! 
>> You are just the man I want, Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm. 
>> You are living upon them. 
>> You are too quick... . 
>> You can imagine all she went through! 
>> You can judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my wife. 
>> You come with such trifles, my good sir, it's scarcely worth anything. 
>> You could only perhaps ruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. 
>> You don't pay her money and you won't turn out of the room. 
>> You don't say she gave it to you? cried one of the new-comers; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw. 
>> You have been drinking with him, too! 
>> You know Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has. 
>> You know how I love you; you are all we have to look to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. 
>> You know your sister's character, Rodya.

>> You may as well know that too, he added, addressing the gentleman, come along, I have something to show you. 
>> You must know, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him. 
>> You were nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. 
>> You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a husband, would you? 
>> You'll forbid it? 
>> You've been a student or have attended some learned institution! 
>> Young man, he went on, raising his head again, in your face I seem to read some trouble of mind. 
>> Your whole life, your whole future, you will devote to them when you have finished your studies and obtained a post? 
>> Yours till death,

>> hideous dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still did not realise this himself. 
>> now, the mare tugged with all her might, but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail. 
>> only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!

>> she'd live on black bread and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein, much less Mr.Luzhin's money. 
>> splendid!

>> the monster! 
>> there's nothing to pity me for! 
>> well, on the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night, I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look at me, all of you!
